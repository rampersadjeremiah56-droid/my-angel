<section class="love-letter">
  <p>My dearest <strong>Solala</strong>,</p>

  <p>I still can’t believe how something as simple as a game brought me to you. One random day in <em>Free Fire</em>, I met someone who turned out to be my whole world. I didn’t know that behind the screen was the person who would change everything for me — the person who’d make my heart feel full in ways I never knew were possible.</p>

  <p>Since <strong>February 6th, 2025</strong>, you’ve been my favorite part of every day. Whether we’re laughing, playing, or just talking about nothing at all, you make every moment feel like it means something. You’ve turned ordinary days into memories I’ll never forget.</p>

  <p>I know I can’t give you much right now — not money or anything big — but what I can give you is all my love, all my support, and all my heart. I’m not perfect, and I’ll never be as perfect as you are, but I’m trying. I’m trying to become someone I can look at and be proud of, someone <strong>you</strong> can be proud of too. People might judge us, maybe because of me, but I’m working every day to be better. I started going to the gym, and honestly, I’m doing better than ever since you came into my life. You gave me purpose.</p>

  <p>I never wanted more, baby — never. I’m living my dream right now, and when I tell you something, I swear on my life it’s true. We’re both going through difficult times, and I know you have it worse than me sometimes, and it makes me mad, really mad. Mad at your family, mad at everyone who can’t see how amazing you are. I just want you to have everything you need.</p>

  <p>It’s crazy to think that the night you came into my life, you became the light in my world without even knowing it. You’ve made me feel something I never thought I’d feel again. I’ve got mad trust issues, I overthink a lot, but with you... it’s different. You make me feel safe. I never feel lied to or left out. My heart trusted you before my brain even knew the real you.</p>

  <p>From today onwards, I promise I’ll do everything I can to keep my word to you, okay? Damn, this fan is blowing into my eyes and making them water for some reason... or maybe it’s just you, baby. It’s <strong>2:35 a.m.</strong> right now, and I’m so tired, but I’d rather write this for you than sleep — because you’ll always be more important. You’ll forever be more important.</p>

  <p>I’ve never felt this kind of love before, and I thank you a million times for it. Even if, somehow, we don’t make it all the way to the end, you’ll always, always, and forever be my number one.</p>

  <p><strong>Forever yours,<br>Jeremiah 💛</strong></p>

    <h2>Our Notes 💌</h2>
    <div class="note">Every day with you feels like my favorite song playing on repeat, Solala. You’re the melody I never get tired of hearing, the one I hum even when the world’s quiet.</div>
    <div class="note">Even miles apart, your smile is the one thing I see everywhere. It’s crazy how someone I met in a game became the light in my real world.</div>
    <div class="note">I fall for you a little more every time we talk. From the very first “hi” in Free Fire to now, you’ve had my heart without even trying.</div>
    <div class="note">You make distance feel small and love feel infinite. Even though I can’t hold you yet, I feel you in every little thing I do.</div>
    <div class="note">This website is my tiny way of saying, you mean everything to me, my sunshine Ola. Every word, every photo here is just another way to show how much I love you.</div>
    <div class="note">When I think about my future, you’re always the first thing I see. I can already picture us looking back at how it all started, February 6th, and smiling.</div>
    <div class="note">No matter how far we are, my heart always finds its way back to you. Maybe that’s because, from the start, it knew exactly where it belonged, with you, my Solala. 💛</div>
